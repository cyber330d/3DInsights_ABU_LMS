The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework used for developing software in a systematic and organized manner. It includes several phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables. The standard SDLC phases typically include:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: 
   - **Objective**: Gather and analyze the software requirements from stakeholders.
   - **Activities**: 
     - Conduct interviews, surveys, and workshops.
     - Document the requirements.
     - Create requirement specifications.
   - **Deliverables**: 
     - Requirement Specification Document (RSD).

2. **System Design**:
   - **Objective**: Define the architecture, components, interfaces, and data for the system.
   - **Activities**:
     - Create high-level design (HLD) documents.
     - Develop low-level design (LLD) documents.
     - Design database schema.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - High-Level Design Document (HLD).
     - Low-Level Design Document (LLD).
     - Database Design Document.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**:
   - **Objective**: Convert the system design into source code.
   - **Activities**:
     - Write code based on design documents.
     - Perform unit testing.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Source Code.
     - Unit Test Cases and Results.

4. **Testing**:
   - **Objective**: Verify that the software meets the requirements and is free of defects.
   - **Activities**:
     - Conduct various tests (e.g., integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
     - Report and fix bugs.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Test Plan.
     - Test Cases.
     - Test Reports.
     - Defect Logs.

5. **Deployment**:
   - **Objective**: Make the software available for use.
   - **Activities**:
     - Install the software in the production environment.
     - Conduct user training.
     - Perform deployment verification.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Deployed System.
     - Deployment Guide.
     - User Manuals.

6. **Maintenance**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure the software continues to operate correctly and efficiently.
   - **Activities**:
     - Monitor the system for bugs and performance issues.
     - Provide updates and enhancements.
     - Handle user support and feedback.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Maintenance Reports.
     - Updated Documentation.
     - Patches and Updates.

### SDLC Models

Several SDLC models outline how these phases are organized, including:

- **Waterfall Model**: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- **Iterative Model**: Involves repeating the SDLC phases iteratively to refine and improve the software.
- **Spiral Model**: Combines iterative development with risk management, focusing on early identification and mitigation of risks.
- **Agile Model**: Emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of functional software through iterative cycles called sprints.
- **V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)**: An extension of the waterfall model that includes corresponding testing phases for each development stage.

Each model has its advantages and is suitable for different types of projects and organizational needs.
