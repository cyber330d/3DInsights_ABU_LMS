**Problem Statements:**


In modern educational environments, traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) often lack the ability to provide immersive and engaging learning experiences, particularly when it comes to complex concepts requiring visual representation. Traditional learning methods often struggle to engage learners, especially in subjects that involve complex concepts or spatial understanding. Textbooks and 2D visuals may not adequately convey certain information, leading to reduced comprehension and retention. Additionally, the integration of three-dimensional (3D) models into educational content remains underutilized, limiting the effectiveness of teaching and learning processes. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the design and development of an innovative LMS solution that seamlessly integrates interactive 3D models, enhancing comprehension, engagement, and retention among learners. Integrating 3D model interaction into an LMS addresses this gap by providing a more immersive and interactive learning experience, catering to diverse learning styles and enhancing understanding. This project seeks to bridge this gap by creating an interactive LMS platform that not only facilitates traditional learning activities but also incorporates 3D model integration to provide a more immersive and effective educational experience.

Existing learning management systems (LMS) lack immersive features, hindering student engagement and comprehension. Traditional educational methods fail to leverage the potential of 3D modeling for enhancing learning experiences, and there is a disconnect between the theoretical content taught in classrooms and its practical application, leading to knowledge gaps among students. Current LMS platforms lack effective tools for visualizing complex concepts, making it challenging for students to grasp abstract ideas. The absence of interactive elements in online learning environments diminishes student motivation and participation. Moreover, conventional assessment methods do not adequately evaluate students' understanding of spatial relationships and three-dimensional concepts. The increasing demand for remote education highlights the need for innovative solutions that replicate real-world learning experiences. Limited access to hands-on learning experiences impedes students' ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. Additionally, the lack of customization options in existing LMS platforms restricts instructors from tailoring content to meet diverse learning styles. Students struggle to retain information presented in traditional formats, necessitating the integration of interactive elements to enhance memory retention and understanding.

Despite advancements in technology, many educational institutions still rely on outdated learning management systems (LMS) that lack the interactive features necessary to facilitate effective learning, particularly in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. This gap in functionality limits students' ability to grasp complex concepts and inhibits their overall learning experience. Traditional text-based and static learning materials often fail to convey abstract concepts adequately, resulting in reduced comprehension and retention. The proliferation of online learning platforms has revolutionized education delivery, but many existing platforms still lack the interactive elements needed to fully engage students and provide meaningful learning experiences. Consequently, students struggle to understand and retain information, and their potential for academic and professional success, especially in STEM-related fields, is limited.

To address these issues, there is a pressing need for the development of a next-generation LMS that leverages 3D model integration. Such a system would provide students with immersive and interactive learning opportunities that mimic real-world scenarios, enhance comprehension, engagement, and retention, and cater to diverse learning styles and preferences. By incorporating 3D model interaction, this innovative LMS would bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, fostering a deeper understanding of complex concepts and cultivating students' interest and proficiency in STEM subjects.
