  - Passwords should be encrypted and stored securely.
  - Users should have the option to reset their passwords if forgotten.

- **Course Management:**
  - The system should allow administrators to create, edit, and delete courses.
  - Courses must include text-based materials, images, videos, and interactive 3D models.
  - Course content should be organized into modules for easy navigation.
  - Users should be able to enroll in courses and track their progress.

- **Assessments and Quizzes:**
  - The system should support the creation and administration of quizzes, tests, and assessments within courses.
  - Different question types (single choice, multiple-choice, true/false, short answer,paragraph) should be supported.
  - Automated grading and feedback should be provided to users upon completion of assessments.

- **User Interaction with 3D Models:**
  - Users should be able to interact with 3D models using mouse controls, touch gestures (for touchscreen devices), or keyboard inputs.
  - Interaction features may include zooming, rotating, panning, and selecting specific parts of the model.
  - Annotations and labels may be added to 3D models to provide additional context or information.

- **Progress Tracking:**
  - Users should be able to view their progress within courses, including completed modules, assessments, and overall course completion status.
  - Progress tracking should be synchronized across devices and sessions.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:**
  - The system should have fast response times for loading course content and 3D models.
  - Response times should be optimized for different devices and network conditions.
  - The system should support a large number of concurrent users accessing courses and interacting with 3D models simultaneously.

- **Scalability:**
  - The system architecture should be scalable to accommodate increasing user numbers and content volumes.
  - Scalability should be achieved through horizontal scaling and load balancing techniques.

- **Availability:**
  - The system should be available 24/7, with minimal downtime for maintenance and updates.
  - Redundancy and failover mechanisms should be implemented to ensure high availability.

- **Reliability:**
  - The system should be reliable and stable, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
  - Backup and restore procedures should be in place to prevent data loss.

**4. Business Requirements:**

- **Revenue Generation:**
  - The platform should offer subscription-based access to premium courses and content.
  - Monetization options may include tiered subscription plans with different levels of access and features.
  - The system should support online payments and subscription management.

- **User Engagement:**
  - The platform should be designed to increase user engagement and retention through interactive learning experiences.
  - Features such as gamification, badges, and leaderboards may be incorporated to incentivize user participation.

- **Content Creation and Management:**
  - Administrators should have tools for creating, editing, and managing course content, including text, images, videos, and 3D models.
  - Version control and collaboration features may be provided to facilitate content development by multiple authors.

**5. User Requirements:**

- **Ease of Use:**
  - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear menus, buttons, and controls.
  - Help documentation and tutorials should be provided to assist users in getting started and using the platform effectively.

- **Accessibility:**
  - The platform should be accessible to users with disabilities, complying with accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
  - Accessibility features may include screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and adjustable font sizes.

- **Personalization:**
  - Users should have the option to customize their learning experience, such as selecting preferred themes or setting learning preferences.
  - Personalized recommendations for courses and content may be provided based on user interests and past behavior.

**6. System Requirements:**

- **Hardware and Software:**
  - The system should be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  - Integration with 3D modeling software or libraries (e.g., Three.js, Babylon.js) may be required for rendering and displaying 3D models.

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Adequate server infrastructure with sufficient storage and bandwidth should be provisioned to handle multimedia content and user data.
  - Cloud-based hosting solutions (e.g., AWS, Azure) may be utilized for scalability and flexibility.

- **Dependencies:**
  - The system may have dependencies on external services or APIs for features such as authentication, payment processing, and content delivery.
  - Integration points should be identified and documented for seamless interoperability.

**7. Interface Requirements:**

- **User Interface Design:**
  - The user interface should be visually appealing, with consistent branding and design elements.
  - Responsive design principles should be applied to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes and devices.

- **Navigation:**
  - Navigation menus and controls should be logically organized and easy to access.
  - Breadcrumbs and progress indicators may be provided to help users track their location within the platform.

- **Search and Discovery:**
  - The system should include search functionality for finding courses, content, and 3D models.
  - Filters and sorting options may be provided to refine search results.

**8. Performance Requirements:**

- **Response Time:**
  - The system should have fast response times for loading course content, assessments, and 3D models.
  - Response times should be optimized for different network conditions and device capabilities.

- **Scalability:**
  - The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing user traffic and content demand.
  - Load testing should be conducted to ensure performance under peak load conditions.

- **Resource Usage:**
  - The system should be optimized for efficient resource usage, such as memory, CPU, and network bandwidth.
  - Caching mechanisms may be implemented to reduce server load and improve performance.
